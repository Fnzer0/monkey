Infection Monkey
====================

### Data center Security Testing Tool
------------------------

Welcome to the Infection Monkey! 

The Infection Monkey is an open source security tool for testing a data center's resiliency to perimeter breaches and internal server infection. The Monkey uses various methods to self propagate across a data center and reports success to a centralized Monkey Island server.
